Matplotlib created a temporary cache directory at /var/folders/lz/tyhc88391sgcv4wx2mg8y1n80000gn/T/matplotlib-i3tc41nj because the default path (/Users/mohakgupta/.matplotlib) is not a writable directory; it is highly recommended to set the MPLCONFIGDIR environment variable to a writable directory, in particular to speed up the import of Matplotlib and to better support multiprocessing.
Matplotlib is building the font cache; this may take a moment.
